                <p>Social media has become a primary form of communication in todays digital age, however, we all know that its common for online content to be inauthentic. Our project aims to bridge the gap between <span class="bold">users’ self-perception and external perceptions on social media platforms</span> by fostering more authenticity than what is typically seen. Ideally, this would lead to a far more genuine portrayal on social media.                </p>
                <p>Our target users are <span class="bold">socially active individuals aged 18–35 </span>who are receptive to self-improvement, and acknowledge the dissonance between their own self-perception and external perceptions of themselves online.                </p>

                <p>We have developed a prototype for an <span class="bold">AI-powered social media analysis extension</span> that analyzes users’ social media (Instagram) posts and provides personalized insights into the discrepancies between their online persona and genuine identity.      <br><br> The app offers strategies for alignment based on psychological principles, empowering users to make conscious choices about their online presence. This concept integrates technology and psychology to facilitate behavior change and promote authenticity.                </p>

                <h2>Initial Features</h2>
                <p>We wanted to ensure the following was included in our iterative design process:</p>
                <p><span class="highlight">01</span> Instagram credentials log-in page
                <br><span class="highlight">02</span> Preliminary core values questionnaire
                <br><span class="highlight">03</span> VibeAI initial profile analysis
                <br><span class="highlight">04</span> Suggestions
                <h2>Lo-Fi Prototypes</h2>

                <p>
                    We employed an iterative design process with real user testing and feedback consideration to create the final product of VibeAI. First, we each individually created one lo-fi prototype, to better understand each group member's thought process. <br><br> My idea is at the top left:
                </p>
                <img src="assets/projects/vibe/lowfi.png" alt="lowfi"/> 
                <p>User testing showed that key desired features include a "vibe check calculator" to assess post vibes and provide specific adjustment recommendations. <br><br>Users also expressed interest in AI-generated feed ideas for new posts, rather than just feedback on existing posts.  </p>   
                <h2>Mid-Fi Prototypes</h2>
                <p>We considered the pros and cons of our 5 low-fi prototypes and created 3 mid-fi prototypes, using componets from each design. I prototyped out the top left again:               </p>
                <img src="assets/projects/vibe/midfi.png" alt="midfi"/>    
                <p>User testers demonstrated a strong preference for having specific recommendations about what to post and what to take down, appreciating the specificity and details <br><br> Users also express varying preferences regarding privacy and feedback sources, suggesting options for real vs AI feedback to enhance accuracy</p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class="box">
                <h1 class="title" id="prototyping"> Final Prototype </h1>
                <h2>Synthesis</h2>
                <p>As a team, we synthesized our user testing feedback to understand what we needed to include in the final protoype. </p>
                <p>In my role as the design lead, I created the entire Hi-Fi prototype using Procreate for drawings and Canva for animations.</p>
                <h2>Onboarding</h2>
                <img src="assets/projects/vibe/onboard.png" alt="onboarding screens"/>   
                <p>With our three onboarding screens, users are able to <span class="highlight-p">self select what their core values are,</span> and what they use instagram for among other questions. While these ideal values can be changed later on in settings, we hope that this primes users to think more about what they truly believe in, before even enteirng the app.     </p>
                <h2>Analysis Feature</h2> 
                <p>After onboarding, our first row of screen-captures shows a personal analysis from VibeAI. </p>
                <img src="assets/projects/vibe/analysis.png" alt="analysis screens"/>    
                <p>On the profile page, the Artificial Intelligence is able to analyze a user’s posts, and inform them which components of their curated “vibe” is misaligned with their self selected core values. <br><br> After clicking the “align” button, users can navigate over more details in their posts. <br><br> Users are given clear suggestions on how to align their content better with their values.</p>
                <h2>Human Input & Chatbot Features</h2>   
                <p>We as a group understood that solely relying on AI can have harmful consequences, so I included a component of human analysis. On the home page, we can see other users who are more than 3 connections away — that is we have 0 mutual connections — and contribute to their analysis as well. <br><br>The idea here would be that these are people who users do not know in real life, and thus they are analyzing their social media and not the person they know. <br><br> These contributions will improve the AI algorithm for other users.</p>
                <img src="assets/projects/vibe/end.png" alt="next feature screens"/>    
                <p>In our final feature, I prototyped a chatbot where users can run posts by VibeAI before posting, to see how well they align with their core values. The chatbot will also make suggestions on room for imrovement.                </p>
