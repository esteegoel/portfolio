                <p>Social media has become a primary form of communication in todays digital age, however, we all know that its common for online content to be inauthentic. Our project aims to bridge the gap between <span class="bold">users’ self-perception and external perceptions on social media platforms</span> by fostering more authenticity than what is typically seen. Ideally, this would lead to a far more genuine portrayal on social media.                </p>
                <p>Our target users are <span class="bold">socially active individuals aged 18–35 </span>who are receptive to self-improvement, and acknowledge the dissonance between their own self-perception and external perceptions of themselves online.                </p>

                <h1 class="title" id="problem"> Solution Overview</h1>  
                <p>We have developed a prototype for an <span class="bold">AI-powered social media analysis extension</span> that analyzes users’ social media (Instagram) posts and provides personalized insights into the discrepancies between their online persona and genuine identity.      <br><br> The app offers strategies for alignment based on psychological principles, empowering users to make conscious choices about their online presence. This concept integrates technology and psychology to facilitate behavior change and promote authenticity.

                <h2>Initial Features</h2>
                <p>We wanted to ensure the following was included in our iterative design process:</p>
                <p><span class="highlight">01</span> Instagram credentials log-in page
                <br><span class="highlight">02</span> Preliminary core values questionnaire

                <br><span class="highlight">04</span> Suggestions
                <p>
                    We employed an iterative design process with real user testing and feedback consideration to create the final product of VibeAI. First, we each individually created one lo-fi prototype, to better understand each group member's thought process:
                </p>
                <h2>Lo-Fi Prototypes</h2>
                <img src="assets/projects/vibe/lowfi.png" alt="lowfi"/> 
                <p>User testing showed that key desired features include a "vibe check calculator" to assess post vibes and provide specific adjustment recommendations. <br><br>Users also expressed interest in AI-generated feed ideas for new posts, rather than just feedback on existing posts.  </p>   
                <h2>Mid-Fi Prototypes</h2>
                <p>We considered the pros and cons of our 5 low-fi prototypes and created 3 mid-fi prototypes, using componets from each design:                </p>
                <img src="assets/projects/vibe/midfi.png" alt="midfi"/>    
                <p>User testers demonstrated a strong preference for having specific recommendations about what to post and what to take down, appreciating the specificity and details <br><br> Users also express varying preferences regarding privacy and feedback sources, suggesting options for real vs AI feedback to enhance accuracy</p>

                <h2>Low-Fi</h2>
                <p>To kick off the prototyping stage, we each created paper prototypes of our own individual  interpretations of the 5 key concepts we chose to pursue. This allowed us to explore a wide breadth of ideas in a short timeframe</p>
                <img src="assets/projects/nor/lowfi.png" alt="low fi protos"/>   
                <p>Of these 25 lo-fi prototypes, our clients were most interested in further exploring the following concepts:                </p>
                <img src="assets/projects/nor/concepts.png" alt="concepts"/>  
                <h2>Mid-Fi</h2>   
                <p><span class="highlight">01</span>   Our advisor pushed us to think about interaction design basics such as: Layout, Content, Flow, and Intended Outcomes. <br> <br> <span class="highlight">02</span>   Our client encouraged us to “break paradigm of serving more content through a card sort” and aim for a “cohesive, innovative punk idea”.                </p>      
                <p>We went back to the drawing board and generated the craziest ideas we could think up for storytelling mechanisms and discovery tools:                </p>
                <img src="assets/projects/nor/midfi.png" alt="mid fi protos"/>   
                <h2>Testing</h2>
                <p>In order to not overwhelm our user testers, we chose five ideas to validate and test, with the aim of identifying which best meet our users' needs                </p>
                <p>We synthesized all of the user feedback from our sessions, and utilized the insights to refine our project scope. We leveraged the different discovery modes uncovered during our research phase to determine which ideas to incorporate into our final high-fidelity prototype, and came up with the following user flow:                </p>

                <p>After showing our client our first iteration, we received valuable feedback regarding the contents and visual design of the Home page. All changes implemented were to ensure users could easily recognize Nor’s purpose and key features                </p>
