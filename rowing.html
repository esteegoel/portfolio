                <p>My rowing journey began in July of 2014 when I was signed up up for a "learn to row" camp. as a soccer player, I was completely uninterested. Used to high-energy competitive sports, sitting in a boat and rowing down a river sounded completely boring. but after day one, I was hooked, and soon dropped soccer to spend the next 10 years obsessed with rowing.</p>
               
                <p>After learning with Montclair's middle school program, I raced and trained with Neried Boat Club from Fall 2014-Spring 2016. In Fall 2016, I joined the Montclair High School team, where we won Nationals, multiple state championships, and won against some of the fastest crews in the US and Canada. I spent summer with ReadySetRow's development team.</p>

                <p>I was recruited as a D1 athlete, but turned down multiple offers and chose Carnegie Mellon for the vast academic opportunities. On the club team, I was a 4-year varsity rower, and served as president & women's captain, transforming the culture of rowing at the school entirely (details below). </p>

                </div>
                
                <p>I now row at the New York Athletic Club. This sport has taught me so much about life and truly shaped me into the person I am today. I like how team oriented it is, how it makes you work for others, and for the whole team rather than just being self-motivated. I love how success in this sport is a direct effect of what you put into it -- there are no "hacks" or "tricks" to rowing, and you can go so far just because of how much you want it.</p>
