                <p>my rowing journey began in july of 2014 when my mom signed me up for a "learn to row" camp. as a soccer player, i was completely uninterested. used to high-energy competitive sports, sitting in a boat and rowing down a river sounded ocmpletely boring. but after day one, i was hooked, and soon dropped soccer to spend the next 9 years chasing the perfect rowing stroke.</p>
                
                <p>rowing certainly has shaped who i am, and many of the key lessons have been carried into the designs i do. </p>
