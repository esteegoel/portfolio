                <p>My rowing journey began in July of 2014 when I was signed up up for a "learn to row" camp. as a soccer player, I was completely uninterested. Used to high-energy competitive sports, sitting in a boat and rowing down a river sounded completely boring. but after day one, I was hooked, and soon dropped soccer to spend the next 10 years obsessed with rowing.</p>
                
                <p>Most recently, I served as president & women's captain, of the CMU Rowing team. </p>

                <p>This sport has taught me so much about life and truly shaped me into the person I am today. I like how team oriented it is, how it makes you work for others, and for the whole team rather than just being self-motivated. I love how success in this sport is a direct effect of what you put into it -- there are no "hacks" or "tricks" to rowing, and you can go so far in this sport just because of how much you want it.</p>
