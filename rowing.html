                <p>my rowing journey began in <span class="highlight">july of 2014</span> (age 11) when i was signed up up for a "learn to row" camp. as a soccer player, i was completely uninterested. used to high-energy <span class="highlight-p">competitive sports</span>, sitting in a boat and rowing down a river sounded completely boring. but after day one, i was <span class="highlight">hooked</span>, and soon dropped soccer to spend the next 9 years <span class="highlight-p">obsessed</span> with rowing.</p>
                
                <p>rowing has certainly shaped <span class="highlight">who i am</span>, and many of the <span class="highlight-p">key lesson</span> have been carried into the designs i create. </p>
                    
                <p>it’s an <span class="highlight">unmatched feeling</span> -- gliding down the river in a shell with oars bending and straightening as they <span class="highlight-p">cut the water</span>, the synchronicity of it all. it’s <span class="highlight">painful</span>, the hand blisters that pop and burst with every stroke, the <span class="highlight-p">extreme</span> soreness combatted only by extravagant stretches and muscle rolling, the odd sequential twisting and positioning of your body parts. it’s <span class="highlight">demanding</span>, long hours of work to shave a second off your 2k test, days of weightlifting to increase your power-to-weight ratio. it’s a <span class="highlight-p">bonding experience</span>, seeing your boat-mates for three hours each day, sharing hotel rooms at regattas, going through the absolute <span class="highlight">best and worst of times</span> together. it’s rowing, the sport i devote so much of my extracurricular time to, the sport that teaches me <span class="highlight-p">discipline</span>, focus, organization, persistence, team work, and how to win or how to handle a loss. i don’t <span class="highlight">ever want to stop</span> rowing.</p>
