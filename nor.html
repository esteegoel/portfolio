                <p>
                    To creatively explore the “jobs” we defined, we implemented the SCAMPER technique—a method that encourages viewing problems through various lenses: 
                </p>
                <img src="assets/projects/nor/scamper.png" alt="SCAMPER"/>    
                <p>Along with my team and our clients, I came up with some unique ideas that would eventually be implemented into our final product. For example, ensuring that the Homepage of Nor leads to the collection, instead of it being an additional click away. </p>
                <h2>Storyboarding:</h2>
                <p>Next, We employed storyboards to visualize and validate the top 15 concepts we voted on, drawing from the wealth of ideas generated during our rapid ideation sessions. My storyboards are the second column from the right.<br> <br>We tested these with five participants to refine our direction and ensure the ideas resonated with potential users. I led two of these sessions.                 </p>

                <h2>Low-Fi</h2>
                <p>To kick off the prototyping stage, we each created paper prototypes of our own individual  interpretations of the 5 key concepts we chose to pursue. My individual ideas are the second row of each column:</p>

                <h2>Mid-Fi</h2>   
                <p>We got feedback on our low-fi prototypes to move forward.</p>
                <p><span class="highlight">01</span>   Our advisor pushed us to think about interaction design basics such as: Layout, Content, Flow, and Intended Outcomes. <br> <br> <span class="highlight">02</span>   Our client encouraged us to “break paradigm of serving more content through a card sort” and aim for a “cohesive, innovative punk idea”.                </p>      
                <p>We went back to the drawing board and generated the craziest ideas we could think up for storytelling mechanisms and discovery tools:                </p>

                <h2>Testing</h2>
                <p>In order to not overwhelm our user testers, we chose five ideas to validate and test, with the aim of identifying which best meet our users' needs                </p>
                <p>We synthesized all of the user feedback from our sessions, and utilized the insights to refine our project scope. We leveraged the different discovery modes uncovered during our research phase to determine which ideas to incorporate into our final high-fidelity prototype, and came up with the following user flow:                </p>
