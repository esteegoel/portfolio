                <p>NOR is a living and open commons for design in Canada. It is a not-for-profit, co-operative and collective effort to document, preserve, and question Canadian material culture.</p>
                <p>Nor evolved from a 20 year old crowdsourced cultural history platform and design resource, and now aims to be a living design museum. The platform's users include design practitioners, academics, students, librarians, archivists, design theorists, and more. </p>
                <p>Our team came up with enhancements that not only modernize the experience of interacting with Nor but also to transform it into a more inclusive, engaging, and educational resource that continues to evolve with its community.</p>

                <img src="assets/projects/nor/scamper.png" alt="SCAMPER"/>    
                <p>Next, We employed storyboards to visualize and validate the top 15 concepts we voted on, drawing from the wealth of ideas generated during our rapid ideation sessions. <br> <br>After creating storyboards for these concepts we tested them with five participants to refine our direction and ensure the ideas resonated with potential users.                 </p>

                <p>After synthesizing our Speed Dating Insights, we evaluated the results by plotting each concept on Impact x Effort and Satisfaction x Functionality matrix. This allowed us to easily identify and prioritize valuable features:                </p>

                <p>To kick off the prototyping stage, we each created paper prototypes of our own individual  interpretations of the 5 key concepts we chose to pursue. This allowed us to explore a wide breadth of ideas in a short timeframe</p>

                <p>Of these 25 lo-fi prototypes, our clients were most interested in further exploring the following concepts:                </p>

                <h2>Mid-Fi</h2>   
                <p><span class="highlight">01</span>   Our advisor pushed us to think about interaction design basics such as: Layout, Content, Flow, and Intended Outcomes. <br> <br> <span class="highlight">02</span>   Our client encouraged us to “break paradigm of serving more content through a card sort” and aim for a “cohesive, innovative punk idea”.                </p>      
                <p>We went back to the drawing board and generated the craziest ideas we could think up for storytelling mechanisms and discovery tools:                </p>

                <p>In order to not overwhelm our user testers, we chose five ideas to validate and test, with the aim of identifying which best meet our users' needs                </p>
                <p>We synthesized all of the user feedback from our sessions, and utilized the insights to refine our project scope. We leveraged the different discovery modes uncovered during our research phase to determine which ideas to incorporate into our final high-fidelity prototype, and came up with the following user flow:                </p>
